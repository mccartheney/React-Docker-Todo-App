# React Todo App with Docker

## Overview

This project is a Todo application built with React.js, utilizing Docker for containerization. 
Users can manage their todos efficiently, including adding new todos, marking them as complete, deleting todos, filtering todos based on their completion status, toggling between light and dark mode, and dragging and dropping to reorder items on the list.

### The challenge (in development)


Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
